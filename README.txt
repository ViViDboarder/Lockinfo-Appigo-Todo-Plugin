Basic Info:
This is a branch off of the original Appigo Todo plugin to support Native Rendering.
The original was a branch off of the Things plugin.
This plugin isn't even alpha!  Compile at your own risk.  I will upload binaries when
I have something stable enough so I don't have to deal with crashes I know exist.

Compiling:
To compile you must only type "make" in the source directory.  You may also edit 
the IP in the Make file to the IP of your iPhone with SSH enabled and then use 
the command "make device install" to install the plugin via SCP from the command line.
